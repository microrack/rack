Motherboard with power and base audio output for synth modules

## Mechanical specifications

* module height
* supply placings
* mount holes

## Mechanical recommendations

* module width as small as possible
* height of controls
* minimal distance between controls

## Electrical specifications

* supply voltage and tolerance
* recommended and maximum current

## Electrical recommendations (for interconnect)

* Many inputs (sum), many outpus (parallel)
* Protect outputs with resistors (100 ohm typ.)
* Use terminator on inputs to prevent change level on connect new source
* Low impedance output (100 ohm typ.)
* High impedance input (1kOhm typ.)
* adjust level of input and output, common only
* use linear regulator for power supply
* 5V gate
* 1 V/oct CV
* 5 Vpp linear level (0 dB)
